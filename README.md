Introduction to Computer Programming Project :
This project is designed to evaluate fundamental programming concepts using Python. It covers topics like data types, operators, 
conditionals, loops, object-oriented programming (OOP), exception handling, and more. The goal is to solve coding problems, submit Python code solutions, and explain them through a video presentation.

Project Overview:
Objective: Solve 30 coding questions covering algorithms, data structures, and various programming paradigms.

Topics Covered: Data types, indexing, slicing, operators, in-built functions, loops, conditionals, OOP, and exception handling.

Deliverables:
1)Python coding solutions for all questions.
2)Collab link containing Python code.

Skills Required:
Proficiency in Python.
Understanding of data types, loops, functions, and OOP.
Ability to implement advanced algorithms and solve problems using data structures.
